netmaze (0.81-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * 
  * Fixed debian/rules, closing bug #16992
  * Moved netserv to /usr/games as well, since it is a binary that
    users need to execute directly.  Left the bots in
    /usr/lib/games/netmaze.
  * Updated README.Debian, which wasn't updated with 0.81-2.2. 
    README.Debian tells users where all the files are installed that they
    need.
